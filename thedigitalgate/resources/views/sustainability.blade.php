                Sustainable Development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. There are 3 primary pillars on which the concept of sustainability
                rests - Environment, Economics, and Equity. While the world is informed enough about the connection of sustainability with the environment pillar- Economics and Equity are often pushed to the sidebars. The economic pillar
                calls for the need for businesses that pump more sustainable products into our world such that they switch from a linear to a circular economy. Meanwhile, the equity pillar emphasizes the need for equitable distribution of
                resources and materials across the globe with any bias.&nbsp;

                Extrapolating these pillars into a sustainable supply chain program, we can derive the need for systematic compliance management, business process re-engineering, restructuring, innovation, and community advancement.&nbsp;

                Material production has risen by 120% since 1995, which is equivalent to 11 billion tons of Co2 in our ecosystem. Two fifths of this carbon footprint is accounted for by first time use material produced by the construction
                industry and another two fifths is attributed to machinery used to produce this material. Imagine this for the first time use material that is going to waste in the form of excess material. We at Industreall realize the
                importance of all three pillars of sustainability and have come up with the next-generation platform that solves the problems of these traditional value chains - Excess Material Stock, Non - Biodegradable Material Components
                and Waste.&nbsp;
